(Research Partner Recommendation System Based on Relevancy of Research Topics)
Academic collaboration can be grouped by different faculty members. This involves searching for relevant research topics in order to collect and analyze information and establishing a new research partner collaboration. A research partner recommender system for academia in higher education can help reduce the time and effort required to establish a new collaboration. Na√Øve Bayes classification makes recommendations with dynamic text search as input values that may extract not only relevant to research topics but also object locations and case studies into consideration. However, classification as output representation is not satisfied for academia. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a non-linear approach to provide a score value instead of classes for more suitable relevant recommendations that can leverage a powerful Sigmoid activation function. We demonstrate our approach using real data from faculty members at the Faculty of Information Technology and Business in a private university in Indonesia. The proposed web-based system helps increase recommendation accuracy for new users.
